Define a class batsman with the following specifications:
Private members:
bcode 4 digits code number
bname 20 characters
innings, notout, runs integer type
batavg it is calculated according to the formula â€“
 batavg =runs/(innings-notout)
calcavg() Function to compute batavg
Public members:
readdata() Function to accept value from bcode, name, innings, notout
and invoke the function calcavg()
displaydata() Function to display the data members on the screen.
